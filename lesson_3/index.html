         <p>The term "motivation" describes why a person does something. It is the driving force behind human actions. <em>Motivation</em> is the process that initiates, guides, 
            and maintains goal-oriented behaviors.</p>
            <p>For instance, motivation is what helps you lose extra weight, or pushes you to get that promotion at work. In short, motivation causes you to act in a way that gets you closer to your goals. Motivation includes the <mark>biological</mark>, <mark>emotional</mark>, <mark>social</mark>, and <mark>cognitive</mark>
                 forces that activate human behavior.</p>

        <h2 class="motivation_header">Types of Motivation</h2>
        <p class="type text">The two main types of motivation are frequently described as being either extrinsic or intrinsic.
        </p>
        <ul id="types">
            <li><a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-extrinsic-motivation-2795164">Extrinsic motivation</a> arises from outside of the individual and often involves external rewards such as 
                trophies, money, social recognition, or praise.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-intrinsic-motivation-2795385">Intrinsic motivation</a> is internal and arises from within the individual, such as doing a complicated crossword puzzle purely for 
                the gratification of solving a problem.</li>

        <h2>Why Motivation Is Important</h2>
        <p>Motivation serves as a guiding force for all human behavior. So, understanding how motivation works and the factors that may impact it 
            can be important for several reasons.</p>

        <h3>
            Causes of Low Motivation
        </h3>
        <p>There are a few things you should watch for that might hurt or inhibit your motivation levels. These include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><mark>All-or-nothing thinking:</mark> If you think that you must be absolutely perfect when trying to reach your 
                goal or there is no point in trying, one small slip-up or relapse can zap your motivation to keep pushing 
                forward.
            </li>
            <li><mark>Believing in quick fixes:</mark> It's easy to feel unmotivated if you can't reach your goal immediately but reaching goals often
                 takes time.</li>
            <li><mark>Thinking that one size fits all:</mark> Just because an approach or method worked for someone else does not mean that it will work for you. If you don't feel motivated 
                to pursue your goals, look for other things that will work better for you.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="tips">Tips for Improving Your Motivation</h2>
        <p>If you're feeling low on motivation, there are steps you can take to help increase your drive. Some things you can do to develop or improve 
            your motivation include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Adjust your goals to focus on things that really matter to you. Focusing on things that are highly important to you will help push you through
                     your challenges more than goals based on things that are low in importance.</li>
                <li>Improve your confidence. Research suggests that there is a connection between confidence and motivation.6 So, gaining more confidence in yourself 
                    and your skills can impact your ability to achieve your goals.</li>
                <li>Remind yourself about what you've achieved in the past and where your strengths lie. This helps keep self-doubts from limiting 
                    your motivation.</li>
                <li>If there are things you feel insecure about, try working on making improvements in those areas so you feel more skilled
                     and capable.</li>
            </ul>
